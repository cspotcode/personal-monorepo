Monorepo for personal projects.  The goal is to reduce duplicated effort and make it
easier to stay consistent between projects.

## Notes

### Adding a pre-existing checkout to this monorepo as a git submodule



---

`git submodule foreach` can run a command for each submodule.
Could be used to periodically update them to the latest master.
Although committing the latest revision to this monorepo isn't really important
as long as my working tree has checkouts at the latest master.
